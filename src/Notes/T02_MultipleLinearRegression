Equation For Multiple Linear Regression
    y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + .... + BnXn
    y -> Dependent Variable
    B0 -> y-intercept
    B1, B2 ... -> slope Coefficient's
    X1, X2 ... -> Independent Variables

Well there are five methods that we're going to discuss of building models.
-->Number 1, is all-in
       -basically it means to throw in all your variable
       -when we do this?
           -you have prior knowledge if you know that these exact variables are the ones are your true
            predictors you don't have to build anything you already know that this is the case.
           -The other one is you have to perhaps like I can't really think of good examples here but maybe there's
            some framework in your company that says that you have to use these variables right.
            So it's kind of similar to prior knowledge but it's not it's not a it's not your decision it's you might
            want to do it differently but there is a framework.
       
-->number 2, is Backward Elimination
       -Step 1 you have to select a significance level to stay in the model.
       -Step 2 you fit the full model with all possible predicter So you kind of do that all in approach which
        we just talked about and you put all of your variables into your model
       -step 3 consider the predictor with the highest P-value. if P>SL(significance Level(alpha)) go to step 5 else go to step 4
       -step 4 remove the predictor
       -step 5 Fit the model without this variable

-->Number 3, is forward selection
        -step 1, select a significance level to enter the model.
        -step 2, fit all the simple regression models y-Xn select the one with the lowest P-value
        -step 3, keep this variable and fit all possible models with one extra predictor added to the one you already have
        -step 4, consider the predictor with the lowest P-value. if P<SL, go to step 3, otherwise go to Finish
        keep not the cureent variable, but the previous variable
   
-->number 4, is bi-directional elimination.
        -step 1, select a SL to enter and to stay in the model
                eg: SLENTER = 0.05 SLSTAY = 0.05
        -step 2, Perform the next step of forward Selection(new variable must have P< SLENTER to enter)
        -step 3, Perform all steps of Backword Elimination (old variables must have P<SLSTAY to stay)
        -step 4, No new variables can enter and no old variables can exit
          Finish -> Your Model Is Ready

-->number 5, is score comparison(All Possible Model)
        step 1, Select a criterion of goodness of fit
        step 2, Construct All Possible Regression Models (2^N) - 1 total combinations
        step 3, select the one with the best criterion
           finish -> Your Model is Ready
