    "# What is Classification?\n",

    "* Another important thing is that it's a type of supervised learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* there are actually a variety of applications of classification from medicine to marketing to business and lots of different areas."

    "* you have customers of a business and you would like to predict which ones are likely to stay and which ones are likely to leave. This is also called churn modeling. Very important because if you can predict which customers are likely to leave your business in the next month or six months, then you can take actions and send them special offers or ask them about their feedback and make certain changes so that they stay.\n",

    "* Another application is email. So for instance, if you get an email, it might be classified as normal mail or it might be classified as important, an urgent mail, it might have a special marker, especially if using Gmail you'll see those little chevrons or triangles at the beginning of a message saying that it's important. Or it might be categorized as a promotion and it might be put into a separate folder so it's not filling up your main inbox which you use for work, or it might be categorized as spam. So spam filters have become very good over the past few years. We barely see any spam in our inboxes and that is thanks to classification algorithms.\n",

    "* you might be working for an insurance company and you want to predict will somebody purchase the health insurance that your company is offering, yes or no, and it's very simple, yes or no. It's a categorical variable. And you might want to be predicting this dependent variable based on an independent variable such as age. So, depending on their age, will they purchase the health insurance plan that your company is offering? So, on the x-axis, we would have age, and on the y-xis, we would have yes or no, did they take up the offer or not. Let's say our x-axis is somewhere between 18 years of age and 60 years of age, and our y-axis simply has binary outcomes, yes and no. So, there's no in between. It's either yes or no. So, we're going to just add this horizontal line for illustrative purposes. So, what will our data set look like? Let's say we've got certain number of observations in our dataset. So, we know people's age and we know\n",

    "It makes no sense.\n",
    "So, that's why the equation for logistic regression\n",
    "is slightly different.\n",
    "Here it is.\n",
    "So, here on the left, we've got, instead of Y,\n",

    "So, we could stop there and we could use these probabilities\n",

    "that's what the logistic regression is used for.\n",
    "We just deal with the probabilities once we have them.\n",
    "But in most cases, we want a binary outcome,\n",
    "a yes or no outcome.\n",

    "our plot into two.\n",
    "Anything above this line, this middle line,\n",
    "anything above with a probability of 50% of higher\n",
    "will be projected into a yes, into a binary one.\n",
    "And anything below the 50% line will be projected into a no,\n",
    "a binary zero.\n",
    "Our points would end up here.\n",
    "So, based on this logistic regression\n",
    "we would make the conclusion\n",
    "that the 35-year-old would not purchase our insurance plan\n",
