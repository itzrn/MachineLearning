Training Set & Test Set
   Lets imagine that u have the task to predict the selling price of cars
   and that is your independent variable and the dependent variable is mileage and age of the car
   and the data have 20 cars in total.
   usually we keep 20% of the data to test and rest for the training.
   so, we will use the training set to build the model
   (lets in this case we are building linear regression -> Y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2)
   and then we will take the data from the test set and start comparing between predicted and actual price
   based on we will decide how good model is.

Feature Scaling
   This is always applied to column.(not applied to cross column)
   It is a technique to standardize the independent features in a data in a fixed range or scale.
   There are multiple type of Feature Scaling, but we will Study two most usable : Normalization and Standardization
   applying feature scaling makes you compare two different type of column in a dataset

   Normalization
      It is the process of taking minimum inside the column, subtracting that minimum from every single value inside the column
      and then dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum.
      And you will end up with the values ranging from 0 to 1. [0;1]

      X' = X - Xmin/(Xmax - Xmin)

   Standardization
      The process is similar instead of subtracting minimum we have to subtract the average and we divide by
      standard deviation.
      almost all the values lies between -3 to +3 or if we have outliers then they can end with the outside of -3to+3

      X' = X - u/sigma
         u -> average, sigma -> variance = underRoot(X - mean/(n-1))
